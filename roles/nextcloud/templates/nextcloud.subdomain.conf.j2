## Version 2024/07/16
# make sure that your nextcloud container is named nextcloud
# make sure that your dns has a cname set for nextcloud
# assuming this container is called "swag", edit your nextcloud container's config
# located at /config/www/nextcloud/config/config.php and add the following lines before the ");":
#  'trusted_proxies' => [gethostbyname('swag')],
#  'overwrite.cli.url' => 'https://nextcloud.example.com/',
#  'overwritehost' => 'nextcloud.example.com',
#  'overwriteprotocol' => 'https',
#
# Also don't forget to add your domain name to the trusted domains array. It should look somewhat like this:
#  array (
#    0 => '192.168.0.1:444', # This line may look different on your setup, don't modify it.
#    1 => 'nextcloud.example.com',
#  ),
